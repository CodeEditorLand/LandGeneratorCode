# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Install the [Extension Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.extension-test-runner)
* Run the "watch" task via the **Tasks: Run Task** command. Make sure this is running, or tests might not be discovered.
* Open the Testing view from the activity bar and click the Run Test" button, or use the hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + ; A`
* See the output of the test result in the Test Results view.
* Make changes to `src/test/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test` folder.
  * The provided test runner will only consider files matching the name pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can create folders inside the `test` folder to structure your tests any way you want.

## Issue Reporting

VS Code users can report issues by using the **Help: Report Issue...** command (`workbench.action.openIssueReporter`), or by typing `issue  ` in Quick Open (`workbench.action.quickOpen`) and then selecting an installed extension. This provides a consistent experience for users to report issues for the core product or installed extensions.

As an extension author, you can integrate your extension in the **Help: Report Issue...** issue reporter flow, instead of contributing a separate issue reporter command. This integration also enables you to attach any additional information when users report an issue.

To integrate in the issue reporter flow, you need to contribute a custom command and a `issue/reporter` menu contribution point. This custom command will invoke `openIssueReporter`.

An example of a contributed command and menu for `contributes` in `package.json` (See [Contribution Points](/api/references/contribution-points) for adding a menu contribution and command):

``` json
"commands": [
    {
        "command": "extension.myCommand",
        "title": "Report Issue"
    }
],
    "menus": {
        "issue/reporter": [
            {
                "command": "extension.myCommand"
            }
        ]
    }

```

We ask extensions that previously contributed a `workbench.action.openIssueReporter` command in the command palette to start using this new issue reporting flow.
